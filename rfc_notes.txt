HTTP url:

HTTP/1.1 defines the sequence CR LF as the end-of-line marker for all
   protocol elements except the entity-body 

 http_URL = "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]

 A port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default
        port for that URI-reference;

        - Comparisons of host names MUST be case-insensitive;

        - Comparisons of scheme names MUST be case-insensitive;

        - An empty abs_path is equivalent to an abs_path of "/"ssssss

Request:

Request-Line   = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF

An  origin server SHOULD return the status code 405 (Method Not Allowed)
   if the method is known by the origin server but not allowed for the
   requested resource, and 501 (Not Implemented) if the method is
   unrecognized or not implemented by the origin server. The methods GET
   and HEAD MUST be supported by all general-purpose servers. 

Request-URI:

Request-URI    = "*" | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority


 An origin server that does differentiate resources based on the host
   requested (sometimes referred to as virtual hosts or vanity host
   names) MUST use the following rules for determining the requested
   resource on an HTTP/1.1 request:

   1. If Request-URI is an absoluteURI, the host is part of the
     Request-URI. Any Host header field value in the request MUST be
     ignored.

   2. If the Request-URI is not an absoluteURI, and the request includes
     a Host header field, the host is determined by the Host header
     field value.

   3. If the host as determined by rule 1 or 2 is not a valid host on
     the server, the response MUST be a 400 (Bad Request) error message.



Status codes:

1xx: Informational - Request received, continuing process

- 2xx: Success - The action was successfully received,
understood, and accepted

- 3xx: Redirection - Further action must be taken in order to
        complete the request

 - 4xx: Client Error - The request contains bad syntax or cannot
        be fulfilled

 - 5xx: Server Error - The server failed to fulfill an apparently
        valid request

Timeout Persistent connections:

   Servers will usually have some time-out value beyond which they will
   no longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make
   this a higher value since it is likely that the client will be making
   more connections through the same server. The use of persistent
   connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of
   this time-out for either the client or the server.

Doubts:
1) What is meaning of * in Request-URI
2) how are file stored in server
